    "# Microsoft Movie Production Analysis\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Kevin Culver\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "***\n",
    "This project analyzed data from online movie databases to determine what factors make a movie more likely to succeed at the box office. Analysis showed that certain film characteristics, such as its genre, budget, rating, or release date were related to greater profit and return on investment. These findings can be used to aid Microsoft's in decisions on what type of films to create as it ventures into film production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "***\n",
    "Creating a successful movie studio takes time, money, and risk. However, a company cannot predict how the movies it produces will be received. Therefore, the point of this analysis was to find what qualities are shared by high grossing films that make them successful. For the present analysis, four questions were asked:\n",
    "1. *What movie genres are most successful?*\n",
    "2. *What time of year is best to release films?*\n",
    "3. *Does budget size impact a movie's profit?*\n",
    "4. *How does a movie's rating affect its profitability?*\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these questions, business recommendations can be provided that will assist Microsoft in making informed decisions about what type of films to invest in and create.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "***\n",
    "The data used in this project comes from two online movie databases - iMDB and The Numbers. Within these databases, each movie is identified by its title or movie id. When combined, these databases provide comprehensive information for each movie, including its genre, rating, release date, budget, and total gross (both domestic and worldwide).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "***\n",
    "This project uses descriptive analysis, by primarily breaking the data into distinct categories or numerically plotting...\n",
    "***\n",
    "Questions to consider:\n",
    "* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?\n",
    "* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "***\n",
    "Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Questions to consider:\n",
    "* How do you interpret the results?\n",
    "* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The evaluation of the data above leads to four business recommendations for Microsoft's entry into movie production.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Limit creation of movies to certain genres.** Recommended genres are animation, adventure, sci-fi, or action. These genres have historically created higher profits than other genres. It is not recommended to produce movies within the documentary, war, or western genres due to historically poor performance at the box office. \n",
    "2. **Release movies during the summer months (May-June) and avoid releasing movies in the fall (Aug-Oct).** Historically, movies released in the summer months have done significantly better than movies released during the fall. \n",
    "3.\t**Budget at least 18 million dollars per movie for a lower budget film and at least 45 million dollars for a higher-budget, high-production movie.**  Higher budget films tend to have higher profit.  Most films having an 18 million dollar budget. However, after a budget of more than 45 million dollars are more likely to produce greater profit. \n",
    "4.\t**Strive to release movies that earn at least a 6.0 average rating.** Movies that earn higher than a 6.0 average rating are more likely to be successful at the box office.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "To further improve on the analysis done in this project, the following steps are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze the budgets of high-grossing, high budget films.** Several factors could contribute to higher budget films having higher profits (e.g., better marketing, top-tier producers and actors, better visual effects). Future research could look into budget distribution to obtain n insights for how to best allocate resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze film characteristics among highly rated films.** The current project concluded  that movies with higher ratings (6.0 or higher) performed better at the box office; however, this finding is quite vague and doesn't produce tangible actions. To improve on this finding, further analysis could be conducted to find shared characteristics among highly-rated movies (e.g., screen-writing, visual effects, fan base, actors, directors). \n",
