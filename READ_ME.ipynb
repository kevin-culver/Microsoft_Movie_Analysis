    "## Overview\n",
    "***\n",
    "The aim of the current project was to provide actionable insights for Microsoft in its creation of a new movie production studio. The project analyzed databases to identify variables that contribute to a movie's success at the box office. Analysis showed that certain factors, such as a film's genre, budget, rating, or release date were related to higher profit and return on investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "***\n",
    "Creating a successful movie studio takes time, money, and risk. However, a company cannot predict how the movies it produces will be received. Therefore, the point of this analysis was to find what qualities are shared by high grossing films that make them successful. For the present analysis, four questions were asked:\n",
    "1. *What movie genres are most successful?*\n",
    "2. *What time of year is best to release films?*\n",
    "3. *Does budget size impact a movie's profit?*\n",
    "4. *How does a movie's rating affect its profitability?*\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these questions, business recommendations can be provided that will assist Microsoft in making informed decisions about what types of films to create. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "***\n",
    "The data used in this project comes from two online movie databases - iMDB and The Numbers. Within these databases, each movie is identified by its title or movie id. When combined, these databases provide comprehensive information for each movie, including its genre, rating, release date, budget, and total gross (both domestic and worldwide).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "***\n",
    "This project primarily uses descriptive analysis. For part of the project, the data was sorted and visualized categorically. This applies well to movies since they can be broken down easily into categories (e.g, genre or month of release). The other part of the project sought to determine if certain factors had an impact on the profit of a movie. Descriptive statistics and visualizations using distributions were used to see if any patterns, relationships, or trends existed. \n",

    "## Results\n",

    "\n",
    "Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Questions to consider:\n",
    "* How do you interpret the results?\n",
    "* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the data above leads to four business recommendations for Microsoft's entry into movie production.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Limit creation of movies to certain genres.** Recommended genres are animation, adventure, sci-fi, or action since these genres generally earn higher profits. It is not recommended to produce movies within the documentary, war, or western genres due to historically poor performance at the box office. \n",
    "2. **Release movies during the summer months (May-June) and avoid releasing movies in the fall (Aug-Oct).** Movies released in the summer months have done significantly better than movies released during the fall. \n",
    "3.\t**Budget at least 18 million dollars per movie for a lower budget film and at least 45 million dollars for a higher-budget, high-production movie.**  Higher budget films tend to have higher profit. The average budget for films is 18 million. However, after a budget of more than 45 million dollars, a film is more likely to produce greater profit.\n",
    "4.\t**Strive to release movies that earn at least a 6.2 rating.** Movies that earn higher than a 6.2 average rating are more likely to be successful at the box office and earn greater than 72 million dollars in profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "*** \n",
    "To further improve on the analysis done in this project. The following steps are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze the budgets of high-grossing, high budget films.** Several factors could contribute to higher budget films having higher profits (e.g., better marketing, top-tier producers and actors, better visual effects). Future research could look into budget distribution to obtain n insights for how to best allocate resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze film characteristics among highly rated films.** The current project concluded  that movies with higher ratings (6.0 or higher) performed better at the box office; however, this finding is quite vague and doesn't produce tangible actions. To improve on this finding, further analysis could be conducted to find characteristics shared among highly-rated movies (e.g., screen-writing, visual effects, fan base, actors, directors).. \n",
